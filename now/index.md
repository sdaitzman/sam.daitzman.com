# PInT
While I was at Olin, I cofounded [PInT](http://pint.olin.edu), Olin's Public Interest Technology Clinic. I also founded and directed the [PInT Fellowship](http://pint.olin.edu/fellowship), which has funded ten talented engineering students to work at public interest organizations over the last three years.
