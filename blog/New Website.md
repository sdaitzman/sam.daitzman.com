# New Website

I just launched my new website. It's still a work in progress, but it's much nicer to work with than the older version. It uses [Vuepress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org) to manage its content and theme.

I can use code blocks with syntax highlighting:

```js
let testFunction = (name) => {
    window.alert(name)
    window.console.info(name)
}
```
