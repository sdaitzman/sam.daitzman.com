# Build Week


## Why?

My schol, Olin College of Engineering, is only about 20 years old, and we have a tradition of treating a lot of spaces on campus like home. Olin used to have a tradition of student-run [Build Days](http://www.olin.edu/events/build-day/), which designated time focused on campus improvements for students, faculty and staff. Thanks to the work of hundreds of now-alumni and their collaborators, Build Day created a strong sense of stewardship and care for the build environment we learn in.

Valuing communal spaces (and allowing them to exist without a designated "owner") has led to some unusual campus features:
- Laundry rooms with student-installed signage that helps walk incoming students through the process if they're unfamiliar.
- Loft spaces that operate as small student-run social spaces, replacing some of the social infrastructure functions of a coffeeshop/bar.
- Door signage that helps visitors (and non-visitors) interpret which direction to open doors. All of this signage was student-installed.
- A student-run "jam room" with communal instruments, which is entirely maintained by the students who share the space.
- A student-created "pool room," which converted an empty stretch of hallway into a social space. As objects wear, students step in to repair or replace them.

There's a sense that, over the years, care and maintenance labor has been devalued. The last Build Day I can find details about was in 2014. I (and three other students who collaborated on Build Week) wanted to facilitate students, faculty and staff at Olin learning how to work together again. The students who initiated Build Week received funding and permission from a few members of Olin's administration, and we started planning.
